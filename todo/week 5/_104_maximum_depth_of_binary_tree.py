104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Trees & BSTs

Problem Description:
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum depth is 3, which is the depth of the path [3,9,null] or [3,20,15].

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
