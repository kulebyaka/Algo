291. Word Pattern II
Difficulty: Hard
Topic: Backtracking

Problem Description:
Given a pattern and a string s, return if s matches the pattern.
A string s matches a pattern if there is some bijective mapping of single characters to non-empty strings such that if each character in pattern is replaced by the string it maps to, then the resulting string is s.
A bijective mapping means that no two distinct characters map to the same string, and no character maps to two distinct strings.

Example 1:
Input: pattern = "abab", s = "redblueredblue"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' -> "red"
'b' -> "blue"

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' -> "asd"

Example 3:
Input: pattern = "abab", s = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible mapping is as follows:
'a' -> "a"
'b' -> "sdasd"
Note that 'a' and 'b' cannot both map to "asd" since the mapping is bijective.

Example 4:
Input: pattern = "aabb", s = "xyzabcxzyabc"
Output: false

Constraints:
- 1 <= pattern.length, s.length <= 20
- pattern and s consist of only lowercase English letters.
