253. Meeting Rooms II
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: Greedy & Intervals

Problem Description:
Given an array of meeting time intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We need two conference rooms.
Meeting room 1: [0,30]
Meeting room 2: [5,10], [15,20]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need one meeting room because the two meetings don't overlap.

Constraints:
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6
